# Date Designer

Date Designer is a tool designed to optimize routes between POIs loaded from a dataset based on distance. The tool uses Google Maps to determine routes and distances between POIs, however a custom graph is
used to determine interactions between POIs and thus chose the shortest distances.

This tool differs from a tool that only minimizes distance between points as the tool guarantees the order of certain POIs allowing users to visualize how they could potentially design a date (hence the name). 
At the moment the tool is configured with a variety of parks, theaters and restaurants in Downtown Toronto, but can easily be configured to work with locations all over the world
